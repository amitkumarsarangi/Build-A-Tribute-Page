              About Prem Rawat
            </summary>
            <hr>
            <p>Prem Rawat also known as Maharaji began speaking about peace at very young age. As a child, he astounded and delighted audiences with his wisdom and clarity.</p>
            <p>At the age of thirteen, his message of peace had reached beyond his native India, and he was invited for the first time to travel to the West. This was the beginning of over four decades of nearly non-stop travel throughout the world, touching
              the lives of millions of people as he spoke to audiences, both large and small. His message is simple yet profound and available in more than 90 countries and 70 languages.</p>
            <p>Prem Rawat is a respected international speaker, attracting audiences from all walks of life. The honorary title <q>Ambassador of Peace</q> has been granted to him by a number of governmental and academic institutions because of his ability
              to inspire audiences to see personal peace as a possibility for everyone.</p>
            <p>As a speaker, Prem Rawat is both accessible and humorous, using stories, analogies, and even poetry to reach his diverse audience. At the same time he has an important message, that personal peace is a fundamental right for all.</p>
            <p>He speaks from the heart, without script or rehearsal, bringing simplicity to important issues that people often find complex. His life's goal is to offer his message of peace to all seven billion of the world's population.</p>
            <p>In pursuit of this goal, he maintains a challenging travel schedule, often flying over 100,000 nautical miles in a year. In 2012 alone he spoke to over 730,000 people at 102 live events worldwide. During that time, there were over a million
              downloads of his videos. He receives no recompense for his speaking engagements.</P>
            <p>In addition to speaking in front of intimate audiences and vast crowds-sometimes exceeding 300,000 in India- he has been invited to speak at a number of important institutional venues and forums. These include the European parliament, the
              United Nations (UN), the Italian Senate, the Parliament of Australia, Argentina and New Zealand, the IIT Delhi, the Young Presidents' Organization, and the Guildhall in London, as well as numerous universities across the world .</p>
